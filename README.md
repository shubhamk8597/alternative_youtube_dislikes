# No Dislikes? No Problem! Comments don't lie.

So, recently youtube decided that it will not show the number of dislikes for a video. Being an avid youtube user, this update did not help me in any way. The number of dislikes and the ratio of likes to dislikes helped me in making the decision whether to watch the video or not in a split second. But now I was helpless. I could not decide on which videos should I invest my precious time on.

I was not going to let youtube have its way. I decided to use my data science skills to solve this problem.

For anyone who wants to decide where to watch a youtube video or not.

Copy the URL of the video that you want to make a decision on. (Currently Supports English Videos only and have at least a few comments)

Click on this link - https://share.streamlit.io/shubhamk8597/alternative_youtube_dislikes/main/yt_comment_nlp.py

Paste it, Press Enter and Relax 
After all the comments are processed(More time if the video has more comments)
You will get the word cloud of the comments. 
The pie charts of the number of positive negative and neutral comments.
The top positive and negative comments and a line chart of incoming comments vs their sentiment.

Now you can decide to save your time or invest it in a youtube video.

Thank you for reading. Please let me know about any suggestions, improvements, code reviews etc.
